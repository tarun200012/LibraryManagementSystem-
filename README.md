# üìö Library Management System (Java Console App)

A simple Java console-based Library Management System demonstrating **OOP**, **SOLID principles**, and **Design Patterns**. It allows users to manage books, patrons, and lending through a command-line interface.

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ Add, update, delete, and search books
- ‚úÖ Register and manage patrons
- ‚úÖ Checkout and return books
- ‚úÖ Track available and borrowed books
- ‚úÖ Console-based user interaction
- ‚úÖ Logs key actions and errors

## üí° Object-Oriented Design

This system uses core OOP principles:

| Principle       | Applied |
|----------------|---------|
| Encapsulation  | ‚úÖ       |
| Abstraction    | ‚úÖ       |
| Inheritance    | ‚ö†Ô∏è (Ready for future) |
| Polymorphism   | ‚úÖ       |

## üîê SOLID Principles

| Principle                    | Usage Example |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Single Responsibility        | Each service (Book, Patron, Lending) has one job |
| Open/Closed                  | Easily add new features without changing old code |
| Liskov Substitution          | Prepared for with expandable models (e.g. Patron ‚Üí PremiumPatron) |
| Interface Segregation        | Ready for interface segregation in future (e.g. Searchable) |
| Dependency Inversion         | Constructor-based injection used in services |

---

## üß† Design Patterns

- **Factory Pattern** ‚Äì used to create `Book` and `Patron` objects.
- (Optional) **Observer Pattern** ‚Äì can be added for reservation notifications.
